  details: |
      I love learning and solving problems, automating tasks, or finding more efficient ways to do them. 
    I've always had a passion for messing with computers, seeing how far I can push my hardware, and finding solutions for people. 
    My favorite fields are cloud computing, virtualization/containers,  and security.
    From my work I have experience reading circuit diagrams and diagnosing electrical issues. I've fixed problems for small business and friends. 
    I run a hobby homelab and linode server I have personal experience with virtual machines, lxc containers, docker containers, Ubuntu server, proxmox, 
    debian, esp32 NAT routers, Linux CLI, nano text editor, grafana, prometheus, linode vps, nginx reverse proxy manager, DNS server, CUPS print server,
    OpenSSH with public and private keys, Git, among other technical skills. Some coding languages I've been learning are html, css, javascript and c. 
    I've taken the Google IT professional certification. I want to know as much as I can and learn from others in the same field as me.
